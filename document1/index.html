                hello.
                this is a bundle of (un-)related works in very different states:
                finished pieces; very rough or quick tests; random notes; few thoughts; work-in-progress projects; experimental exercises.
                they appear in no particular order (e.g. a randomized order).
                the randomness of the order transparently expresses the concurrency of trajectories that i experienced during the last months.
                i want to be open; porous to any encounters; resisting strong opinions; being guided by coincidences; being guided by gravity (to borrow simone weils term):
