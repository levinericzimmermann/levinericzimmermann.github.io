Raised in the Black Forest, Levin Eric Zimmermann studies composition at Folkwang University of the arts, Essen, Germany. He developed a distinct interest in too long &amp; too slow performances in the course of multiple study visits to Indonesia. In his music he examines precise intonation &amp; algorithmic methods. Emphasizing a hypercultural aesthetic, he loves to collect musical instruments, ancient radios &amp; other real &amp; virtual (sound) objects from contradictory time-space positions that can become part of his work.
