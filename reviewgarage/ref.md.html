<p>i feel welcomed &amp; invited by the humbleness of the
‘underdeveloped’ exhibition (the humbleness of the work that doesn’t aim
to convice me as an ‘audience’, that does not even acknowledge me as an
‘audience’, that rather transforms me to a voice &amp; to a witness
&amp; to a guest &amp; to a chef, that is deliberately unobtrusive, that
does not carry the intimidating power of a so-called ‘masterwork’).</p>
<p>i feel intrigued &amp; challenged by the questions the exhibition
raises with regards to the relationship between art &amp; reality. after
reading christopher smalls ‘musicking’ paper from 1999, these questions
became my main concern <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>i started to think, to provide musicians freedom creates a
<em>real</em> practice of celebrating peaceful coexistence together. i
started to think, to tune in is not merely a physical process of aiming
simple frequency ratios, but it’s <em>really</em> a tuning in &amp; a
carefully listening to each other.</p>
<p>i was thinking of fluxus, john cage, tehching hsieh, pauline
oliveros, cornelius cardew, eva-maria houben.</p>
<p>&amp; i was thinking of aethopian scrolls of bible texts &amp; bible
scene paintings that belonged to a person &amp; that protected this
person from any illness.</p>
<p>&amp; i was thinking that someone once told me ‘wayang kulit’ is not
the play of a story, but during wayang the story <em>actually
happens</em>.</p>
<p>&amp; i was thinking of ‘fasnacht’ masks that we use in the south of
germany to scare the winter away.</p>
<p>there is a contrast between the implicit political context of playing
music without a conductor &amp; without an audience, &amp; the explicit
political context of collecting donations for the people in
palestine.</p>
<p>is implicitness a privilege for the privileged? is explicitness able
to tackle fundamental changes? is implicitness without any consequences?
is explicitness preserving the joy of the senses?</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>smalls text helped me to verbalize a hunch that i
already carried with me for many years. i remember going to a punk
concert with some friends, where i was complaining about the discrepancy
between the anti-authoritarian content of the lyrics &amp; the
stage-audience separation that resembles the hierarchy of church
services.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
